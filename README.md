# Java Trial

[![GitHub Actions Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/huangsam/java-trial/ci.yml)](https://github.com/huangsam/java-trial/actions)

Playground to assess new features and popular libraries on Java LTS versions.

Check out my [Kotlin Trial] and [Scala Trial] to try out the other JVM stacks!

release it to the public for feedback and inputs!
